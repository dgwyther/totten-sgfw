# DATASCIENCE PROJECT TEMPLATE
## Project description
When this is cloned into a new project, make sure to replace THIS `Project description` with a description of the actual project!

## Template description
This is my attempt at formulating a repeatable, standard data science project structure. I have perosnalised it to fit the kind of science that I do. It is subject to change as my needs evolve.

Current structure follows this form:

- `data/`
Contains the raw data, processed data and finalised data.

- `docs/`
Contains any documentation that should be preserved with the project.

- `notebooks/`
This folder contains scripts for data exploration. These scripts should be named following a standard structure. Code snippets will be eventually folded into finalised research scripts.

- `output/`
Contains the finalised research, for example scripts for making data tables, figures for papers. 

- `src/`
Any functions taht are repeatedly used will be save in here, including for standard data loading and processing, standard analyses and visualisations.
